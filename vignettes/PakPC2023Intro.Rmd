# Introduction

The [PakPC2023](https://github.com/myaseen208/PakPC2023) package contains data sets and functions for [Pakistan Population Census 2023](https://www.pbs.gov.pk/).


## Province Level

Figure \@ref(fig:Fig2) shows the population of Pakistan by region and area. The data is based on the Pakistan Population Census 2023 and shows that the majority of the population in Pakistan lives in rural areas, with over 147.75 million people living in rural regions compared to just over 93.75  million people living in urban regions. Punjab has the highest rural population with over 75.71 million people, while Sindh has the highest urban population with over 29.92 million people.

The figure is presented as a multiple bar chart, with each region represented by a different color. The y-axis shows the total population in millions.
